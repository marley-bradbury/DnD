# Red Plume Chasm Development Plan
## Current Situation
![alt text](Stage_0.png "Title")
After the tunnelling operation, Red Plume City (soon to be "Red Plume Old City") has been connected to the overworld by a long tunnel angled at 45 degrees stemming from Camp Mors on the surface. Due to the angle of the tunnel and the hot air from the Red Plume City causing an updraft to develop in the tunnel, the ash from the surface has not been able to reach the city. However, continually losing prima infused air to the surface is not sustainable in the long term and the open entrance presents a serious security risk to the people of Lettree.

Currently the people of Lettree are living in Red Plume City taking refuge in the abandoned old buildings. While the Sparverius are able to fly freely through the tunnel, those who have not been gifted with flight are forced to climb the 45 degree rock face. While just about functional, the massive spires of the old city could broken down and reconstructed more efficiently into a new city. One not so reminicent of the worst days of the Sparverius...

## Proposed Development Plan
### Building Stage 1 - Constructing the Steel Dome

The most pressing matter is the leaking of the prima infused air and establishing a more robust system of defense against the surface. The "Steel Dome" proposed aims to regulate updraft outflow and scrub it of it's precious prima materia.

Spanning the entire entrace hole, this Dome will also provide a more robust protective place to mount the defensive turrets build to fight the demons on the surface.

### Building Stage 2 - Excavation

Once a the tunnel has been secured with the steel dome, greater habitation of the Red Plume city will become feasible. To enable expansion it is proposed that a series of rings is to be carved into the sloped rock faces creating new flat land on which new buildings can be built.
